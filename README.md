# rgettingandcleaningdata
This repository contains all files for the project in 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
More specifically, using a dataset on human activity recognition using smartphones, the objective of this project is to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
(1) merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
(2) extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
(3) uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
(4) appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names; and,
(5) from the data set in (4), creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
